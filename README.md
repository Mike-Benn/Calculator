# Calculator
This project is a web-based calculator app that can be used inside a browser.  Users will be able to perform basic arithmetic by typing in expressions on the calculator using their mouse.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This app is a collection of buttons and associated mouse listeners that execute mathematical expressions based on what the user punches in to the calculator.  For the most part values are captured from the screen's text and assigned to variables when the user presses an operation or the equals button.  Once the variables are set and the user clicks equals, or an operator, the calculator computes the result of the two values and the operator assigned and returns it to the bottom of the screen.  There is a separate box encompassing the top of the screen that displays what the user has input.  This calculator handles many things similarly to the Windows Calculator.


## Optimizations


I think some easy optimizations I might consider with this project is the addition of some more common buttons that might be found on a calculator more advanced.  Calculations like square roots and exponents would probably be the next things I'd consider adding.  I'm pretty happy with the layout, sizing, and spacing of the buttons so if I was going to add more buttons I'd have to increase the size of the calculator and rearrange things.  I would also consider improving my code and how it handles the states of certain things like negatives and last button pressed.  I wasn't sure how to handle what the upper and lower limit of the calculator should be.  Maybe I'd consider increasing this but maybe not, it would depend on what other functions I add to the app.  It felt silly to add large upper and lower limits to a calculator that is performing the basic arithmetic operations.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was created after my Sketchit project and I think the biggest thing I can take away from this and partly from that one is that I need to improve how I manage states of certain things.  I could've done a much better job tracking certain variables like the last button clicked and how that can be used better to my advantage.
